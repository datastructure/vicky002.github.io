Just [my personal blog](http://vicky002.github.io) sources.

# Please read this!

If you want to fork this repo to make your own blog or something, PLEASE change
the info in `_config.yml`. Things like Disqus, Analytics tracking code are
personal. If you just do the fork-rename thing without changing this stuff,
you will fuck my metrics and I will get a little mad. So, please, change
those stuff. It's easy.
