Hello everyone :)

I just decided to start posting in my own blog. I have two blogs with some friends on [Quora](https://prmgevryday.quora.com/) and [Blogger](http://topblogcoder.blogspot.in/). All posts were mostly on Algorithms and others Technical stuff. My last post was a long time ago(because it's not exciting anymore).

I don't really like Blogger or Wordpress. Yeah, I just don't like it. I think both are very heavy and slow. I have decided now that I'll try use open source platforms, softwares as much as I can. So, I decided to give a chance to [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

I'll not blog about "*how to setup Jekyll*", you can read it [here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com).

It's really simple to configure and put to work, write posts, pages, and you can see the modifications on your local server. And Yeah, it's really fast!

In two hours, I updated the [twitter bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) version, hacked jekyll to be responsive, worked on posts listing and setup author and other things like analytics and disquss. It also have built-in support for Disqus and Twitter/G+/Facebook/etc (aka [addthis](http://www.addthis.com/)) buttons. 


In short Jekyll is great, and I really liked it!


This is my first post, I have thought of writing one post in a week. If you're interested in reading my posts, you can [leave your email here](http://eepurl.com/bIgxHz) (expect one mail in a week :) ).
