title: "Code Every Day"
---

Hello!

Fourth blog post after 20 days! I have decided that I'll write one blog post each week. But time constaints aren't allowing me, I am quite busy nowadays, morning 7 to evening 11 this is my timing, college and then my internship. But I don't feel tired, this is time to learn things and accept challenges!

ok so,  

I read a blog post and now I'm inspired by [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/) (Who was in turn, inspired by [Jennifer Dewalt](http://jenniferdewalt.com/)), I am going to write code every day, starting today. I hope to write about my coding progress regularly on this blog.

## Why I intend on writing as I go along

- Obligate myself to actually code every day (though this may not work because this blog has practially no readership)
- Keep a log of my progress over time
- Recall the reasoning I used when justifying decisions (e.g. this list describes why I decided to blog while doing this)


## What I hope to gain from this


- Better programming skills and intution. Improved familarity with tools, paradigms, etc.
- Improve my algorithmic knowlegde.
- Learn new languages, frameworks etc. by application rather than just reading docs.
- Create some interesting projects, hopefully some worth mentioning in a technical interview or something (for those "describe a time you ran into a problem when programming and how you fixed your problem" type questions)
- Spend free time more productively (as of now, coding seems like a much more useful way of spending my free time then chatting on WhatsApp or watching prank videos on YouTube)
- Meet people, become more familiar with the many programming communities on the internet.

## Ideas what to do each day

This section is more of just a brainstorm/dump of different ways I can code each day.

- Learn a new language or framework. On my to-learn list: Dart, Go, R and other JavaScript web frameworks.
- Solve problems on different Coding platforms and Interview problems.
- Play with APIs and write tools for myself and the community.
- Contribute to open Source projects.

## What are the projects currently I'm working on 

- [Charmandar](https://github.com/vicky002/Charmander) : A New Bot for Slack, I'm trying to bring Google right there in your Slack channel. I'm working on it since a month and it is still under development.
- [Milotic Theme](https://github.com/vicky002/Milotic): Milotic is a new theme for all text editors available. Theme for sublime and Visual Studio is available and under development for other text Editors.
- [FCC-Downloder](https://github.com/vicky002/FCC-DL): FCC-Downloader is script to download all your solutions on [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com).
- [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com): Next Week I'll analysing data of FCC. You can join the [gitter channel]() for more information about the project.

That's all!
