*How can I help you see that you deserve to be happy?*

*How can I help you wake up?*

*How can I help you believe in youself?*

*How can I help you believe in you and me?*

*How can I help you trust yourself? So that you can then trust me?*

*How can I help you believe in love?*

*How can I help you see all that we can be?*

*How can I help you still be you, but a better you, with me?*

*How can I help you see that you deserve to be happy?*


---

*How can I help you in doing the things you love?*

*How can I help you in learning new things?*

*How can I help you in giving your best everywhere?*

*How can I help you grow?*

*How can I help you open up?*

*How can I help you commit to us?*

*How can I help you give me your heart?*

---

*But who will help me?*

*Am I ignoring my own right to be happy waiting on you?*

*Who is going to help in believe in myself?*

*Who is going to help me to grow?*

*Who is going to be my mentor?*

*Who is going to motivate and encourag me?*

*Who is going to put as much work into me, as I am putting into them?*

*I trust myself, but who is going to allow me trust them and stay true?*

**Who is going to help me believe in love?**

I hope you liked it! :)
